# public-cloud-infrastructure

In order to perform this task, I chose the public cloud, AWS, and used CloudFormation as the Infrastructure as code tool. Using the yaml code, I created an EC2 instance that uses User Data to set up an nginx server with a simple static page displaying Hello World. I expanded this infrastructure taking care of good security practices. I set up an Application Load Balancer inside a VPC network that balances traffic to two EC2 instances located on different subnets for a highly available infrastructure. VPC and subnets are user selectable and created in yaml code as parameters. To simplify the implementation, I used the default VPC, in which there are already ready resources, such as public subnets, Internet Gateway or routing tables. As a security element, I've set up security groups that restrict the allowed incoming traffic to the EC2 instance. Finally, I configured a bucket in the Amazon S3 service, which receives previously set Flog Logs monitoring network traffic inside the VPC virtual network.
